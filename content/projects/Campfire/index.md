##### Introduction

This project aims to simulate the real campfire in a forest. There are several skills I used for the realisic. 
-  **Skybox**: I used the skybox as the background of the environment. 

- **Toon Shading**: The rocks' reflection.

- **Inner part of the fire**: The geometry shader made it like the melting lava. 

- **Outer part of the fire**: The geometry shader with additional sin randomness made flaming effect.
